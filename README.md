A haskell library providing a way for treating with types that represent values (especially integers).
There already is the "reflection" library, but it doesn't offer a way to construct first order types that represent values.
This library tries to fill this hole:
	* represent integers as types
	* represent tuples of integers as types
	* is compatible with the reflection library
